This CodingTask project contains a mock up of AscoPlc. AscoPlc is the component that our software uses to communicate with a PLC.

Your task is to add a UserControl to the MainWindow, which visualizes the current values of all PLC Variables listed in the enumeration MitsuRVariables.
Please use MVVM pattern.
For each PLC variable, show the current value, the adress and description.
Make it look similar to the content in Example.png. In particular, if the variable is a boolean use background color to indicate its value: red for false, green for true.

You are free to use nuget packages to complete this task if you want.
